🌊 **Dive into the deepest culinary adventure!** 🌊  

Open a restaurant at the bottom of the **Mariana Trench** with a blobfish named **Steve**!  

Your task is to meet the sea guests, seat them at the table, find out their order, memorize and serve the right dish. But **be careful**: customers are impatient and easily swim away if you wait too long!

Keep an eye on your guests’ desires, don’t mix up orders and **prove** that even at the deepest depths you can serve to the highest standards.
